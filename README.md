# Flooring-Mastery

This is a Java console app that creates an ordering system for a flooring company. It takes in information about a new order, allowing user to choose floor material, square footage, state and date delivered. The app calculates costs, including tax for the state, cost of materials, cost of labor and total order cost. Persistence is achieved by writing a new file for each delivery date, which includes all orders for that date.
